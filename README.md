# Portfolio (starter)

This is a minimal starter portfolio. Customize the files:

- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — small JS for nav & form
- `resume.pdf` — add your resume to enable download link

How to run locally:
1. Save files into a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve with a simple static server:
   - Python: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - Node: `npx serve .`

Deploy:
- GitHub Pages: push to `main` (or `gh-pages`) and enable Pages in repo settings.
- Vercel / Netlify: connect repo and deploy.

Customize:
- Replace "Your Name" and contact details.
- Add project images and real links for each project card.
- Integrate a contact backend (Netlify Forms, Formspree, or your API).

If you'd like, I can:
- Generate a GitHub repository and push these files (tell me repo name & owner).
- Convert this to a React / Next.js / Hugo / Gatsby starter.
- Improve design (colors, fonts, animations) or make a multi-page site.
